Hi there,<br/>
My name is Syed Minam ur Rehman, and I am an aspiring AI engineer with a strong passion for technology and programming. Born and raised in Karachi, I come from a middle-class family that has always encouraged my curiosity and drive for learning. My journey into the world of programming began at a young age, and I have since developed expertise in several programming languages and frameworks, including TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, React.js, C++, and Python (Conda).<br/>
I completed my matriculation in March 2024 and have been pursuing further studies in Generative Applied Engineering at PIAIC since July 2023. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also undertaken projects such as developing a CLI-based ATM system using Node.js and running a fashion brand named Zarak.<br/>
With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I am committed to leveraging my skills to contribute to innovative projects and drive technological advancements. I am always eager to learn new technologies and apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems.<br/>
Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my work and how to get in touch with me.
<h2>Education</h2> 
I began my formal education in 2011 when I was admitted to Programmer School in class Nursery. This foundation laid the groundwork for my academic development and sparked my interest in technology and programming. I progressed through the school, culminating in my completion of matriculation in March 2024. For ninth and tenth grade, I studied at MAK Collegiate (Up More Campus), where I further honed my academic skills and deepened my interest in various subjects. In addition to my school education, I have been enhancing my knowledge and skills by studying at the Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) since July 2023. At PIAIC, I am focused on Generative Applied Engineering, which is helping me deepen my understanding of AI and related technologies.<br/>
